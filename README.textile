h1. Karel (now in Python)

Karel is a pretty snazzy environment for learning to program. You can "read about it here":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language). I decided to write a Karel environment for Python, after seeing that all of the others had too many dependencies for beginners.

Press 'c' to exit.
Program pauses when Karel tries to make an illegal move.
