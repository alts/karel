# Karel (now in Python)

> Karel is a pretty snazzy environment for learning to program.
> You can [read about it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language)).\
> I decided to write a Karel environment for Python, after seeing that all of the others
> had too many dependencies for beginners.

## Installation

Installing should be as simple as opening your terminal and writing:
```bash
pip3 install karel_robot
```

## Write simple Karel programs

Coding in Python is **super fast and easy**!
Save a text file `YOUR_PROGRAM.py` in this folder, use import and start coding!

```python
from karel_robot.run import *
# Simple program
move()
turn_left()
move()
```

> For a true unix executable, add the [shebang](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19305076/11105559),
> then the right to execute with `chmod +x YOUR_PROGRAM.py` and run it as `./YOUR_PROGRAM.py`.



## Karel functions

These are the functions you can use to command Karel after importing from `karel_robot.run`:

| Function              | Result                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Movement**          |                                                   |
| `move()`              | Karel moves in the direction he is facing         |
| `turn_left()`         | Karel turns left                                  |
| `turn_right()`        | Karel turns right                                 |
| **Beepers**           |                                                   |
| `pick_beeper()`       | Karel tries to pick up a beeper                   |
| `put_beeper()`        | Karel puts down a beeper (if he has any)          |
| `beeper_is_present()` | True iff Karel stands on a beeper                 |
| **Walls**             |                                                   |
| `front_is_blocked()`  | True iff Karel can't move forward                 |
| `front_is_treasure()` | True iff Karel is standing in front of a Treasure |
| **Direction**         |                                                   |
| `facing_north()`      | True iff Karel is facing north (`^`)              |
| `facing_south()`      | True iff Karel is facing south (`v`)              |
| `facing_east()`       | True iff Karel is facing east (`>`)               |
| `facing_west()`       | True iff Karel is facing west (`<`)               |
| **Execution**         |                                                   |
| `set_karel_beepers(None)`| Set Karel's beepers, with `None` as inf.       |
| `set_speed(100)`      | How fast Karel moves, 0 to 100                    |
| `pause()`             | Pause execution, press any key to continue        |
| `exit()`              | End execution                                     |


Note that the map is loaded and screen started in the moment of import:
```python
from karel_robot.run import *
```
If you only need raw objects and methods see the directory [karel_robot](./karel_robot).



## Karel world

Karel maps are also simple text files and look like this one:

    1..#...
    #....^.

Karel is represented by the arrow (`^`) looking up on the empty tile (`.`).\
There are two walls (`#`) and one beeper in the upper right corner (`1`).
There is no treasure (`$`).

> Planing to write maps? Check out the vim highlighting! :)



## Run your program

Open the terminal and write this command:

```bash
python3 YOUR_PROGRAM.py YOUR_MAP.karelmap
```

Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit or <kbd>P</kbd> to pause program.
Program pauses when Karel tries to make an illegal move.



## Try out your map with *interactive*

Use the command:
```bash
karel YOUR_MAP.karelmap
```

You can now use your keyboard to control Karel.

|     Key    |  Function       |
|------------|-----------------|
|<kbd>‚Üë</kbd>| `move()`        |
|<kbd>‚Üê</kbd>| `turn_left()`   |
|<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>| `turn_right()`  |
|<kbd>I</kbd>| `pick_beeper()` |
|<kbd>U</kbd>| `put_beeper()`  |
|<kbd>Q</kbd>| `stop()`        |

## Examples

You can try these examples or study them for great knowledge.
You can always quit their execution with <kbd>Q</kbd>.

### Example treasure

Run the program `treasure.py` (also below) with worlds `00` - `03_window`.
Karel will walk to the wall and then search for a treasure in the walls.

![Karel finds the treasure.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsebek/karel/master/images/introduction_00.gif)&emsp;![Karel cycles.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsebek/karel/master/images/introduction_01.gif)&emsp;![Karel hits the wall.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsebek/karel/master/images/introduction_03.gif)

The idea comes from a [paper on cooperative learning in CS1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2492686).

  ```python
  from karel_robot.run import *
  
  while not front_is_blocked():
      move()
  
  while not front_is_treasure():
      turn_left()
      if front_is_blocked():
          turn_left()
      # FIX: add else
      move()
      turn_right()
  ```

### Langton's ant

The program `langton.py` (also below) makes Karel a [Langton's ant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant),
using a single beeper to mark a tile as "Black" and Karel can pick it up to make it "White".

![Karel programmed as Langton's ant](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xsebek/karel/master/images/langtons_ant.gif)

The ant moves seemingly randomly, but makes a nice picture in about 11000 steps. Try with the world `04_140x50`.

<details>
  <summary>Langton's ant Python code</summary>

  ```python
  from karel_robot.run import *
  set_speed(100)

  while True:  # repeat
      if beeper_is_present:  # At a black square
          pick_beeper()          # flip the color of the square
          turn_left()            # turn 90¬∞ left
          move()                 # move forward one unit
      else:                  # At a white square
          put_beeper()           # flip the color of the square
          turn_right()           # turn 90¬∞ right
          move()                 # move forward one unit
  ```
