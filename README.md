# Karel (now in Python)

> Karel is a pretty snazzy environment for learning to program.
> You can [read about it here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_(programming_language)).\
> I decided to write a Karel environment for Python, after seeing that all of the others

## Installation

Installing should be as simple as opening your terminal and writing:
```bash
pip3 install karel_robot
```

## Write simple Karel programs

Coding in Python is **super fast and easy**!
Save a text file `example.py` in this folder, use import and start coding!

```python
from karel_robot.run import *
# you can call imported functions
turn_left()

# or use Python, like loops ('while') or logical 'not'
while not front_is_blocked():
    move()

```

> For a true unix executable, add the [shebang](https://stackoverflow.com/a/19305076/11105559),
> then the right to execute with `chmod +x YOUR_PROGRAM.py` and run it as `./YOUR_PROGRAM.py`.



If you are learning Python and want to check the implementation, this [[ADD LINK]] is the last simple version.
The new package allows you to resize screen and many more.
Generally, if you break the karel program, it should not leave your terminal screen broken in retaliation.
More advanced or courageous programmers are welcome to look at the karel_robot folder and read about the details.



## Karel functions

These are the functions you can use to command Karel after importing from `karel_robot.run`:

| Function              | Result                                            |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Movement**          |                                                   |
| `move()`              | Karel moves in the direction he is facing         |
| `turn_left()`         | Karel turns left                                  |
| `turn_right()`        | Karel turns right                                 |
| **Beepers**           |                                                   |
| `pick_beeper()`       | Karel tries to pick up a beeper                   |
| `put_beeper()`        | Karel puts down a beeper (if he has any)          |
| `beeper_is_present()` | True iff Karel stands on a beeper                 |
| **Walls**             |                                                   |
| `front_is_blocked()`  | True iff Karel can't move forward                 |
| `front_is_treasure()` | True iff Karel is standing in front of a Treasure |
| **Direction**         |                                                   |
| `facing_north()`      | True iff Karel is facing north (`^`)              |
| `facing_south()`      | True iff Karel is facing south (`v`)              |
| `facing_east()`       | True iff Karel is facing east (`>`)               |
| `facing_west()`       | True iff Karel is facing west (`<`)               |
| **Execution**         |                                                   |
| `set_karel_beepers(None)`| Set Karel's beepers, with `None` as inf.       |
| `set_speed(100)`      | How fast Karel moves, 0 to 100                    |
| `pause()`             | Pause execution, press any key to continue        |
| `message(text, pause)`    | Show a text message to user.                      |
| `save()` | Save the map in file specified by `--output`. |
| `exit()` | End execution |


Note that the map is loaded and screen started in the moment of import:
```python
from karel_robot.run import *
```
If you only need raw objects and methods see the directory [karel_robot](./karel_robot).



## Karel world

There are many maps in [`world`](.world) directory. Karel maps are simple text files and look like this one:

    1..#...
    #....^.

Karel is represented by the arrow (`^`) looking up on the empty tile (`.`).\
There are two walls (`#`) and one beeper in the upper right corner (`1`).
There is no treasure (`$`).

This does not allow us to use more then 9 beepers and place Karel on beeper or other non-empty tile.

#### New Karel map format

A new map format has file extension `.km2` but it is still plain text file ‚àí you can change it to `.txt`:

```
KAREL 2 1 > N
#  1  .  #  #  .  . 21
#  #  9  .  #  .  #  #
6  .  .  .  .  .  .  #
```

The above map places Karel right on the 9 beepers.
Note that there are 21 beepers in the upper right corner in one tile.
The mysterious `N` in Karel's header sets the number of beepers he starts with to unlimited, which is the most fun.

## Run your program

Open the terminal and write this command:

```bash
python3 YOUR_PROGRAM.py  # -m YOUR_MAP.karelmap or other options
```

Press <kbd>Q</kbd> to quit or <kbd>P</kbd> to pause program.
Program pauses when Karel tries to make an illegal move.

<details><summary><h3>Example treasure</h3></summary>
Run the program `treasure.py` (also below) with worlds `00` - `03_window`.
Karel will walk to the wall and then search for a treasure in the walls.

The idea comes from a [paper on cooperative learning in CS1](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2492686).

<details>
  <summary>Karel searching for treasure Python code</summary>

  ```python
  from karel_robot.run import *
  
  while not front_is_blocked():
      move()
  
  while not front_is_treasure():
      turn_left()
      if front_is_blocked():
          turn_left()
      # FIX: add else
      move()
      turn_right()
  ```

<details><summary><h3>Langton's ant</h3></summary>

Here is a short compressed animation of Karel playing
Langton's ant.<sup>[[wiki]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)</sup>

<img src="images/langton_optimized.gif" alt="langton_optimized" width="40%"/>

The program `X_langton.py` (also below)  uses a single beeper to mark a tile as "Black"
and Karel can pick it up to make it "White".
The ant moves seemingly randomly, but makes a nice picture in about 11000 steps.
The options used in the recording are:
```bash
programs/X_langton.py -x 70 -y 50 --karel 35 25 --direction ^ --speed 0 --output langton.km2
```

<details>
  <summary>Langton's ant Python code</summary>

  ```python
  from karel_robot.run import *
  set_speed(100)

  while True:  # repeat
      if beeper_is_present(): # At a black square
          pick_beeper()           # flip the color of the square
          turn_left()             # turn 90¬∞ left
          move()                  # move forward one unit
      else:                   # At a white square
          put_beeper()            # flip the color of the square
          turn_right()            # turn 90¬∞ right
          move()                  # move forward one unit
  ```
</details>
</details>




## Try out your map with *interactive*

Run the `karel` script with any of the options:
```bash
karel --help                       # 0. prints the actual usage
karel                              # 1. opens in infinite map, fills the whole screen
karel -m "world/00_window.km"      # 2. opens the simple text file map in world directory
karel --ix -m "world/E3_tiny.km2"  # 3. one line infinite "tape" with content of file
```

You can now use your keyboard to control Karel.

|     Key    |  Function       |
|------------|-----------------|
|<kbd>‚Üë</kbd>| `move()`        |
|<kbd>‚Üê</kbd>| `turn_left()`   |
|<kbd>‚Üí</kbd>| `turn_right()`  |
|<kbd>I</kbd>| `pick_beeper()` |
|<kbd>U</kbd>| `put_beeper()`  |
|<kbd>Q</kbd>| `stop()`        |

> There is also <kbd>W</kbd> for saving to file (specified by `--output`) and couple of keys for ~~cheating~~ testing!




## Recursive Karel

You can try your wits in creating iterative programs with only **if** statements, procedure definition and recursion!
It is pretty mind bending so lets look at an example:

```markdown
DEFINE MAIN
    IFWALL PUT MOVE
    IFWALL SKIP MAIN
END
RUN MAIN
```

After the program is parsed and run, the `MAIN` function will call itself again until it reaches a wall.
When that happens, Karel will put down a beeper and the execution stops.

Here is a more complex recursive program searching through a maze in search for a tile with two beepers:
